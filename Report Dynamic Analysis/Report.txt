TRiD Information
-----------------
Identify any file type with TrID
=================================
It’s not uncommon to encounter unknown file types, especially if you receive a lot of emails with attachments in them. Of course, before clicking on any of these unknown files, it’s best to identify what kind of file it is because they might be malicious and could harm your PC. TrID is a tool that identifies unknown file types for users. Developed by Marco Pontello, TrID can provide users with the information they need to know about a file before they open it.  


 .exe |   UPX compressed Win32 Executable (39.3%)
 .exe |   Win32 EXE Yoda's Crypter (38.6%)
 .dll |   Win32 Dynamic Link Library (generic) (9.5%)
 .exe |   Win32 Executable (generic) (6.5%)
 .exe |   Generic Win/DOS Executable (2.9%)

This gibves an indication that it could be Malware as UPX and Crypter have the highest probability

Same Process ID
Session ID gets deleted.

Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\90059C37-1320-41A4-B58D-2B75A9850D2F\catalog.dat
This is the file released by the antivirus companies(Specifically NORTON AV) which is dropped by this malware.

\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\90059C37-1320-41A4-B58D-2B75A9850D2F\run.dat
The compromised process creates an 8-byte file called run.dat in specified folder. So to remove the footprint it drops the file

File contains another file: signature: AutoIt, location: UPX1, offset: 0x00050799, size: -1S

MSBuild - a tool used for building apps and gives users an XML schema “that controls how the build platform processes and builds software” - to filelessly deliver RemcosRAT, and RedLine stealer using callbacks. The malicious MSBuild files we observed in this campaign contained encoded executables and shellcode, with some, hosted on Russian image-hosting site, “joxi[.]net.” While we were unable to determine the distribution method of the .proj files, the objective of these files was to execute either Remcos or RedLine Stealer. The majority of the samples we analyzed deliver Remcos as the final payload.
