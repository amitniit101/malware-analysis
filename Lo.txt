   - Automate user lifecycle management processes, including onboarding, moving, and offboarding. This can reduce the average time for provisioning and improve the overall user experience.
   - Identify opportunities to integrate with HR systems to automate user provisioning based on HR events.

3. **Centralized System for Access Requests:**
   - Implement a centralized system for raising access requests across all applications. This can simplify the request process for end-users and provide better visibility and control for administrators.

4. **Legacy Tool Maintenance and Support:**
   - Consider migrating to a modern IAM solution that is actively supported and meets the organization's current and future needs.
   - Evaluate the total cost of ownership (TCO) for maintaining the existing legacy tool versus adopting a more cost-effective and scalable solution.

5. **Service Resiliency and Regional Deployments:**
   - Evaluate the resilience of the existing system and address deployment challenges across regions.
   - Explore cloud-based IAM solutions that provide scalability and resilience without the need for extensive regional deployments.

6. **IAM Non-Compliance Reports:**
   - Implement reporting and analytics capabilities within the IAM system to generate non-compliance reports. This can help in identifying and addressing security and compliance issues.

7. **Cost Savings and CAPEX Reduction:**
   - Consider a cost-benefit analysis for migrating to a modern IAM solution. Evaluate the potential savings in terms of reduced maintenance costs, improved efficiency, and decreased manual efforts.

8. **Vendor Support and Collaboration:**
